CHAPTER
There are mountains in the picture.
This is a great picture.
I like the movie.
Movies are awesome.
There are tall mountains, high mountains, small mountains, low mountains and no mountains.
Tall people can climb high as well as low mountains, short people can climb only low mountains.
These are good mountains, not to climb.
Mountains are tall and short.
Draw picture on the wall.
Picture of a flower.
Flowers are awesome too.
