CHAPTER
There are buildings in the picture.
This is a good picture.
I like the movie.
Movies are awesome.
There are tall buildings, high buildings, small buildings, low buildings and no buildings.
Tall people can climb high as well as low buildings, short people can climb only low buildings.
These are good buildings, not to climb.
buildings are tall and short.
Draw picture on the wall of the buildings.
Beautiful high rise buildings are a rarity.
Good to see down from the top.
